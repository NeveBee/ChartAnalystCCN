ChartAnalyst is a deep learning research platform that recognizes stock charts through Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We have seen financial advisors explaining a lot on a stock chart with trend lines and fancy indicators. But all the audiences want to know is if the price will be going up or down, and more precisely, what is the probability that the price goes up or down to a certain level. In the similar enigmatic way, CNN also can give the probability result to each stock chart. This project draws stock charts from the history data and trains CNN to classify these charts according to the future price direction. It is a basic platform that can be easily improved to include any technical indicators in the chart without changing the model.

The platform invokes Keras library (http://keras.io) for CNN calculation. The back end can be Theano or Tensorflow. I used Theano since it is much faster on my Mac.
